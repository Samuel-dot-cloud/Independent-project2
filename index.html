                <p>This is a simple yet very interactive webpage designed to to utilize your input on gender and your birthday, then assign you an Akan name based on the results found for the day you were born.</p>
                <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their childen after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names
                    have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
                <p>Most Ghananians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian name. Notable figures with day names include Ghana's first president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah"> Kwame Nkrumah,</a>                    and former United Nations Secretary-General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan"> Kofi Annan.</a></p>
                <p>For the purpose of this project, we will only be assigning a first name.</p>
