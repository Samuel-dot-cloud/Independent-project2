## PROJECT DESCRIPTION.
The project is basically a webpage that requires you to key in essential information concerning your gender and birthday, after which it alerts you of your assigned Akan name, together wity the actual day that you were born on. The site is able to achieve this through the use of JavaScript.
### AUTHOR INFORMATION.
My name is Samuel Dot, currently a programmer at Moringa School who believes in efficiency through coding.
### SETUP INSTRUCTIONS.
The project makes use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript in order to make it work. It also requires advanced coding software such as Atom and Visual Studio Code.More programming was also done through use of JsFiddle which enabled me to test out my JavaScript code to ensure it worked seamlessly.
### BDD.
When the project was still in a planning phase, it was thought up with the intention of having the ability to collect a user's information about their birthday and gender, then relay to them the specific day they were born and assign them an Akan name. All this would have to be achieved through the use of JavaScript, by the assigning of conditions in the various functions.
### KNOWN BUGS.
The site seems only to give male Akan names and does not have special conditions for February, which is a leap year.
### TECHNOLOGIES USED.
The project can run on any browser whose edition is later than 2015, as the project makes use of JavaScript concepts that were introduced in 2015.The project can run on most phones, tablets, and laptops, so long as they have a highly dedicated processor.
### CONTACT INFORMATION.
